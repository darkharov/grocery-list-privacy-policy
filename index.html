  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1. Analytics Data</h3>
    <br />
    We use Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google LLC, to collect information about how users interact with the App. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the functionality and performance of the App.

      <li>Advertising identifiers (such as the Google Advertising ID)</li>
      <li>IP address (used for approximate location and technical purposes)</li>
    </ul>
    This data does not include information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.
    <h3>2. Advertising Identifier</h3>
    The App may collect and use the Advertising ID provided by your device. The Advertising ID is used for analytics and measurement purposes only and is not used to directly identify you as an individual.
    <br />
    You can reset or limit the use of the Advertising ID at any time through your device settings.

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
    We do not sell or rent your data to third parties.
    <br />
    However, the App uses third-party services that may collect information as described in their own privacy policies, including:

    These third-party services process data in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable laws.
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    Analytics data is retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
