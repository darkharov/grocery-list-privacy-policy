This Privacy Policy describes how Grocery List on Lock Screen (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Android application (the “App”).
By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
1. Analytics Data
<br />
We use Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google LLC, to collect information about how users interact with the App. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the functionality and performance of the App.

  <li>Advertising identifiers (such as the Google Advertising ID)</li>
  <li>IP address (used for approximate location and technical purposes)</li>
  <li>This data does not include information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Advertising Identifier</h2>
The App may collect and use the Advertising ID provided by your device. The Advertising ID is used for analytics and measurement purposes only and is not used to directly identify you as an individual.
<br />
You can reset or limit the use of the Advertising ID at any time through your device settings.

<h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>

The App may send you push notifications to provide important updates, reminders, or other relevant information.
<br />
Push notifications do not require us to collect personal identifying information. You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings.

The App uses a local database on your device to store app-related data necessary for the App’s functionality. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
